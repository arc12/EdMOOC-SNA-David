Network Tools
========================================================

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **MD** toolbar button for help on Markdown).


This will generate graphml files for everything in forum, at the moment this is based on posts in a thread, bungs them in the output folder, comment this out if you don't want the Gephi files:

```{r}
source("network_tools/graphml_generation_tool.R")
```

We can also figure out the top inbetweenness centrality for each poster:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```
