A Distant Reading of the Edinburgh online course posts
====

Introduction
----
This is based on work by [Ben Marwick] (https://github.com/benmarwick/dayofarchaeology) and Adam Cooper and is a scripts and ideas thrown togther to look at the posts within the forums for each of the courses. It uses [topic modelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model/) to get some insights into what users talk about.

#### Summary of the topic model

TODO: This currently just uses posts in the forum_posts folder. 
TODO: break down of different forums
TODO: Try different paramaters when building models, may need different per course
TODO: More topics/word per topic? More burn in?

Here are 5 key words for the 30 topics generated by the LDA model for each forum:

Topics are generated by a probabilistic algorithm.
 
#### Ways to use the models

We can check individual posts to see what topics they are posting about

TODO: People who didn't survive
TODO: Roles
TODO: In the middle

![fc1c4306aae418a2bea27e2a3415048b015b3a6b topics](fig/individual.png)

#### Visualisation of similar topics

Not sure this works, think the Gephi thing was better:

![cluster of topics](figures/related.png)

#### Comparison of topics in threads

We can get an idea of the topics in threads. This is the equine forum and we can see [17] "br nbsp problem page video"  is big in the tech feedback forum

![difference in threads](figures/topicdiffs.png)

#### Groups of similar authors

We could authors group together according to the mixtures of topics in their posts.  This example is based on authors in the aiplan
because it was faster to compute..

TODO: look at these groups and their roles
TODO: Check if this is working as planed

Ben's notes -> Here are the groups of authors I get after a k-means analysis on topic proportions. I arbitrarily set the number of groups at 30 (you can run the code yourself and change the number to see what happens). With additional effort we could [algorithmically determine the optimum number of groups](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15376075/cluster-analysis-in-r-determine-the-optimal-number-of-clusters/15376462#15376462). If there is a number after the name it's because that author has more than one post on the blog. Reassuringly, most of the time we see multiple posts by the same author in the same cluster. Although we saw above that it's not always the case that one author writes about the same general mix of topics in their posts.

#### Visualisation of author groups

Here is a static visualisation of the relationship between all the authors. We get a quick sense that there are distinctive groups, but it's too small to show author names which is a major limitation.
![static visualisation](figures/static.png)

Here is a [slightly interactive visualisation](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/benmarwick/dayofarchaeology/master/figures/d3net.html), where we can see names on the nodes (click on them to magnify the name) and inspect them in more detail by dragging them around. 

An even more interactive version can be downloaded [here](https://raw.github.com/benmarwick/dayofarchaeology/master/figures/g.graphml) (right-click -> save link as...) and opened in [Gephi](https://gephi.org/). 

Discussion and Conclusion
----
To return to the questions that motivated this little investigation, we can get some answers from what is missing from the results, as well as what is present. A reassuringly absent term is 'dinosaur', since this is often mistakenly associated with the archaeology. The last dino died out 65 million years ago, well before any people-like creatures were around (things get interesting to archaeologists around 2 million years ago). Key terms that are not prominent in the topics are pyramids, temples, whips and any kind of firearm. This suggests that a day in the life of the most popular Hollywood archaeologists has little in common with the people contributing to the day of archaeology. However, there is a small area of intersection since we see terms like 'treasure', 'gold', 'coins' and 'looting' in topic 8. This suggests that popular depictions of archaeologists as people who do things with treasure and valuable items are not completely wrong (for some lucky archaeologists, at least). We might now ask how are exactly do archaeologists get their gold, coins,  pots (the most frequently mentioned type of artefact) and other items that are less exotic but more commonly discussed during the day of archaeology? And once they've got these artefacts, what are they doing with them?

The obvious answers of survey and excavation feature prominantly in the topic model, especially topics 1 and 15. We also get some insights into other activities related to site discovery such as the use of geophysics and aerial photography. The context of site discovery and artefact recovery is frequently one where education and community engagement are priorities. For example, topic 10 inlcudes mentions of students and children, and topic 3 references learning, communities and kids. The discovery and recovery process is also quite labor intensive, especially when it comes to producing documentation. We see terms relating to documenting finds, such as forms, records and database across several topics.

Stepping away from the serious analysis of the topics for a moment, we do some simple text mining of the posts for some insights into how the fieldwork documented on the blog compares to fieldwork we seen in the movies. Here are a pair of charts that show total word counts for some words relating to fieldwork. This one shows the kinds of tools archaeologists write about. No whips or fedoras, but guns are mentioned a few times. [Closer inspection](http://www.dayofarchaeology.com/?s=gun&submit=) indicates that when archaeologists write about guns, they are usually talking about them as archaeological artefacts, not as persuaders. The high frequency of mentions of computers is no doubt due to their use at all stages of archaeological activity from the field to the lab and classroom.

Next we have a chart showing a sample of things that pose dangers to archaeologists in the field. Extremes of temperature are problematic, followed by dangerous animals and dangers of falling or becoming entombed. The problem of snakes is one that is shared by real word and film archaeologists, but Nazis seem to be uniquely a Hollywood concern. Mention of aliens is because of [this post by  Serra Head](http://www.dayofarchaeology.com/sometimes-you-just-have-to-debunk-it/) on her passion for public education and de-bunking stories of aliens building ancient monuments.

Finally, we can mine the text to see what kinds of artefacts archaeologist typically collect during their fieldwork. Here we see that pottery is the winner, followed by other materials that are easily recognisable as raw materials for ancient food, tools and shelter. It seems that no-one took home a grail after their fieldwork, but finds of [treasure](http://www.dayofarchaeology.com/?s=treasure) (or museum work on them) are quite normal, especially from the Iron Age and Roman periods.

Those three charts are of course tongue-in-cheek (and the code is in the repository so you can make your own with any combination of other tools and dangers) and quick-and-dirty (for example I've not attempted to deal with homonymy, for example by distinguishing between hot as in spicy and hot as in summer weather). However, we can clearly see a few differences between popular images of archaeologists and how archaeologists describe themselves. 

Before we put the pickaxe away, there is one more question we can address with this kind of simple text mining. What's the balance of writing about males versus females? Or who features more often in the day of archaeology, female archaeologists or male archaeologists? We can get a bit of glimpse into this by looking at counts of male and female pronouns in the blog text. Here are all the gendered pronouns (ie. excluding 'it', 'they', 'we', etc), showing females in the lead:

![all pronouns](figures/gender1.png)

And here's the aggregate view, with all the different pronouns combined by gender. This confirms it: females are nearly twice as frequently mentioned than males. With the data available from this brief analysis it's difficult to know exactly what to make of this, is it because there are more female contributors to the day of archaeology blog than males? Or are there more females doing archaeology in general? Or do archaeologists tend to attribute a female gender to objects they anthropomorphize?

Now, back to the topic model. While field activities such as excavation and survey seem prominent in the topic model, we get relatively little insight into the post-excavation analytical process. Labs are mentioned in topics 3, 24, 29, but the other terms in these topics suggest the lab work relates to conservation and preservation. Topic 26 is the exception, as it seems to be include a Neolithic faunal analysis that involves isotope analysis. This topic also notable for its negative sentiment - 'difficult', this may be one reason why relatively few people are writing about lab analyses. Another reason might be that it can be hard to know what to write about in the middle of lab work, when the interpretations are still emerging from the fog of data. Compare this to the positive sentiment elsewhere, for example topics 13, 17, 18, 22, and 3 with 'interesting', 'happy', 'fun' and 'enjoy'. We might conclude that archaeology is generally a pleasant activity, except for the lab research bits. 

The post-excavation activities that are most prominent in the topic model relate to the conversation and display of artefacts and of course writing about the artefacts and their contexts for scholarly publication and public communication. Topics 8 and 21 mention museums, collections, exhibitions and related terms, which are also scattered throughout several other topics. Terms describing artefact conservation, such as 'conservation', 'cleaning', 'fragile' and 'corrosion' are distributed across a several topics. 

But the topic model has more than just excavation, survey, sites, artefacts and museums. A related post-excavation activity that frequently appears in the topic model can be described as heritage management. This is signalled by terms such as 'heritage', 'management', 'policy', 'law', 'council', government', 'rescue', 'client' and 'commercial'. These terms are most concentrated in topic 11 as well as appearing scattered throughout other topics. This is probably an aspect of archaeology that is least expected by the general public, where archaeologists work with governments and businesses to create plans and implement methods to protect archaeological sites and artefacts and make them accessible to the public. 

A final set of activities that is unexpected in the topic model is what we might describe as the digital humanities in archaeology. Digital humanities refers to [many things](http://tapor.ualberta.ca/taporwiki/index.php/How_do_you_define_Humanities_Computing_/_Digital_Humanities%3F) but one broad definition is [research that uses information technology as a central part of its methodology, for creating and/or processing data](http://digital.humanities.ox.ac.uk/Support/whatarethedh.aspx). In this topic model it is most prominently indicated by topic 4 with terms such as 'database', 'metadata', 'digital', 'open', 'access', 'image', 'video', 'text', 'app' and 'online'. On one hand, perhaps it's not surprising that people who chose to write for the day of archaeology blog are interested in digital humanities topics, since participation in blogging and social media are highly valued activities in the digital humanities. Perhaps archaeologists whose work intersects with digital humanities self-select to contribute to the day of archaeology blog, leading to over-representation in the topic model. On the other hand, we may be seeing a rising trend in the application of digital humanities approaches in archaeology (this essay is part of the trend, the text mining and topic modelling here are inspired directly by some of my favorite historians and literature scholars). Analysing next year's set of posts will help to test that idea.

To conclude, I set out to use some basic information retrieval methods to get some basic insights into what archaeologists do on a typical day (without having to closely read a vast amount of text). I downloaded all the posts on the day of archaeology blog from 2012 and 2013, generated a topic model and did some simple text mining. The results show some interesting differences and similarities between what real archaeologists do and what we see archaeologist-like characters do in Hollywood films. We've seen how fieldwork, education and community engagement are linked and widely discussed, and how mentions of lab analyses are rare. We've noted the activity of many archaeologists in conservation, curation and heritage management activities. Clearly there are a lot of archaeologists employed in these roles, which are perhaps not obvious career paths for people who graduate with a degree in archaeology (not obvious to the parents and friends of the graduates, at least). We've noted the appearance of the digital humanities in archaeology and wondered if it's an artefact of the sample or a real trend. 

I see a lot of what I expected in the results of this analysis. The activities represented in the topics are all things I tell undergraduates to expect as ways of making money and getting satisfaction from their training in archaeology. As an assistant professor of archaeology I didn't see many of my own day-to-day activities represented in the topics, there don't seem to be many academic archaeologists contributing to the day of archaeology. For the most part we are reading about the work of students and people involved in heritage management and museum projects. There are a few reasons that might explain this. First, academic archaeologists are simply much fewer in number compared to students and archaeologists working in consulting and management fields. Second, archaeologists working in heritage management might be more comfortable and willing to participate in outreach and public education projects like the day of archaeology. For academic archaeologists this may be a lower priority and a less familiar form of expression, compared to research and university teaching. Of course these are just speculations, though they might be tested with a focused survey. 

There's plenty more that could be done with a dataset like this one. For example, we could ask about what ancient time periods are most frequently written about, and what parts of the world are most represented and see how that changed between 2012 and 2013. We might ask what kinds of archaeological theories are people using when they're really doing archaeology, and how does that relate to the kind of archaeology they do. We could get a bit more sophisticated with statistics to refine the topic model and use some fancier text mining methods like named entity recognition, stylometrics, collocation analysis and sentiment analysis. All of these are fairly straightforward to implement in R, and doing so is left as an exercise to the reader (do let me know what you find!). 

As a final note, this has also been an experiement in [open science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) and [reproducible research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility#Reproducible_research). Obviously this essay is not a highly scientific work, but it's completely open (ie. no login or subscription required). All the data and code to reproduce the results are freely available, for example on the day of archaeology blog and the code repository attached to this essay (and the software to run the code is aslo free and open source).  This approach to research is uncommon in archaeology, perhaps because of the relatively small scale of most archaeological research compared to fields where openness and reproducibility are more normal (ie. astronomy and genomics). It might be worth considering making this normal for archaeology, not least for the lowering of barriers to putting to work of archaeologists into the hands of the public, and helping them get a richer understanding of what the past was like, and how we know what it was like.
